# Make-me-a-password

## Description

- I made this website for users to be able to generate a secure password using their selected criteria.
- This was a more challenging project for me as there is a lot of information to keep track of, but I learned a lot about storing data in variables and how to manipulate strings and arrays. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
